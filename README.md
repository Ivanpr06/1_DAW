# 📖 1_DAW
<p>In this folder, you will find my first projects on my journey to becoming a professional programmer, studying in Safa Reyes's education cycle 🎓</p>

## 🗃️ Folders
<p>Here, I will explain how this repository will be structured:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><h4>📂 Lenguajes de Marcas</h4>
      <p>In Lenguajes de Marcas, you can find some code written in <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and <b>JavaScript</b>. Moreover, I have had the opportunity to learn about tools like <b>Visual Studio Code</b> 
      and <b>Bootstrap</b> 📱</p>
      </li>
      <li><h4>📂 Programación</h4>
      <p>In Programación, you can find some code written in <b>Python</b> and <b>Java</b>, combined with other tools like <b>MySQL</b> and <b>Qt Designer</b> 📟</p>
      </li>
      <li><h4>📂 Entorno de Desarrollo</h4>
      <p>In Entorno de Desarrollo, you can find some <b>Pseint</b> code as an introduction to <b>Python</b>, as well as some projects in this language that are more specific to solving problems and learning 
      how to use the debugger effectively 🔴. Meanwhile, there are also other exercises on <b>UML</b> and how to use it correctly. ⚙️</p>
      </li>
      <li><h4>📂 Base de Datos</h4>
      <p>In Base de Datos, you can find some code written in <b>MySQL</b> to create a database. Previously, we learned how to do this by designing an E/R Diagram and a Relational Model using <b>Draw.io</b>. 📊</p>
      </li>
      <li><h4>📂 IP</h4>
      <p>In IP, you can find some information about workers' rights, the salaries they can earn, and more. This subject is more theoretical, so it is not very relevant to programming. 👨‍🔧</p>
      </li>
      <li><h4>📂 Sistemas Informáticos</h4>
      <p>In Sistemas Informáticos, you can find varied information about many aspects of programming, such as Ubuntu, binary code, and the components of a PC. 🖥</p>
      </li>
      <li><h4>📂 Proyecto Final</h4>
      <p><b>Ristorannte Ramos</b> is a website developed with <b>Django</b>, simulating the official site of a fictional restaurant. This project was created for educational purposes, applying both backend and frontend web development skills, as well as concepts such as design, routing, data models, and user authentication. 🍝</p>
        <h6>The website includes features such as:</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Viewing the restaurant menu</li>
          <li>Online reservations</li>
          <li>Admin panel</li>
          <li>User registration and login</li>
          <li>Product and order management</li>
        </ul>
